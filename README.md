<h1> Bluetooth Remote Controller</h1>
<p>For Reel-to-Reel tape recorders and vintage cassette decks.</p>
<p>Works with any open-reel (reel-to-reel) tape deck equipped with remote control connector, with active-low inputs</p>
It replicates functionality of original Technics remote controllers such as RP-9690 and RP-070 (including reverse-play function).</br>
Connects to remote controller input on Technics RS1500, RS1506 and RS1700 and also on Akai GX-635, GX-636, GX-747, GX-747DBX, GX-77 and also vintage cassette decks.</br>
This Bluetooth remote can be wired to other makes and models of tape machines, as long as they are equipped with a "tactile" tape transport buttons and "active-low" logic, such as Pioneer RT909.</p>
