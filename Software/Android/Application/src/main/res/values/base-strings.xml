        Bluetooth Remote for Reel-to-Reel tape recorders.
        It replicates functionality of original Technics remote controllers such as
        RP-9690 and RP-070 (including reverse-play function).\n
        Connects to remote controller input on Technics RS1500, RS1506 and RS1700
        and also on Akai GX-635, GX-636, GX-747, GX-747DBX and GX-77.\n
        This Bluetooth remote can be wired to other makes and models of tape machines,
        as long as they are equipped with a \"tactile\" switches and \"active-low\" logic.
